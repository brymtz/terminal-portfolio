                    My enthusiasm for cybersecurity has led me to participate in CTFs and immerse myself
                    in the world of Red Team where I am better known as {glow("Exayfer")}. I'm passionate about
                    the challenge of protecting systems and networks, and I find it fascinating to discover
                    vulnerabilities and devise strategies to prevent them.

                    and security audits. My personal goal is to be part of challenging projects that allow me to improve 
                    my skills and later found a cybersecurity company in Ecuador.
